# Data Visualization with Tableau: HR Analytics Dashboard  
**Author:** Mirriam Jepleting  

---

## Introduction  
This project presents a comprehensive **Human Resources (HR) Analytics Dashboard** developed using **Tableau**.  
The purpose was to visualize workforce data and uncover insights related to hiring, employee demographics, performance, and compensation.  

The dataset used contained records of employees, departments, job titles, and demographic information such as age, gender, education, and salary. It provided a strong foundation for analyzing workforce distribution and trends within an organization.  

The project demonstrates my ability to transform raw HR data into actionable insights through **data cleaning, exploration, and interactive visualization** â€” resulting in an executive-ready dashboard that enhances HR decision-making.

## Project Objectives  
- Build a fully interactive dashboard for monitoring HR performance indicators.  
- Analyze employee trends in hiring, retention, and attrition.  
- Explore demographic patterns by age, gender, and education.  
- Identify performance and salary trends across departments.  
- Present findings in a professional, visually engaging Tableau dashboard.

---

## Data Preparation and Exploration  
The dataset was imported as a text file and explored across several key dimensions.  

### Data Cleaning and Formatting  
- Standardized field names and data types for consistency.  
- Removed redundant and incomplete records.  
- Created calculated fields for improved segmentation and comparison.  
- Defined a consistent visual style with a dark background, soft grey font, and clear color contrast for better readability.  

### Exploratory Analysis  
Preliminary exploration included summary statistics, frequency distributions, and early visualization drafts to guide dashboard layout and chart selection.

## Summary Overview  

### 1. Workforce Overview  
Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards were used to highlight:  
- **Total Employees**  
- **Total Hired Employees**  
- **Total Terminated Employees**  

These metrics gave an instant overview of workforce size and movement.

### 2. Hiring and Termination Trends  
**Line and area charts** were combined to visualize the number of employees hired and terminated over time, revealing workforce growth trends and turnover fluctuations.

### 3. Departmental Structure  
A **bar chart** displayed employee distribution by department and job title, providing visibility into department sizes and identifying areas with staffing imbalances.

### 4. Headquarters vs Branch Comparison  
A comparative **bar chart** illustrated workforce distribution between the headquarters and branch offices. The results highlighted the dominance of the headquarters in overall staffing.

### 5. Geographic Distribution  
A **map visualization** showed employee locations by city and region, providing geographical context for staffing patterns and branch expansion planning.

## Demographic Analysis  

### 1. Gender Distribution  
A **dual pie chart** depicted gender ratios, segmented by employment status (active and terminated). This provided insights into gender representation across employment outcomes.

### 2. Age and Education Distribution  
A **bubble chart** mapped age groups against education levels, revealing workforce qualifications and generational trends within the organization.

### 3. Employee Count by Age Group  
A **horizontal bar chart** summarized employee totals within each age group. The most represented age bracket was **35â€“44**, indicating a mature, mid-career workforce.

### 4. Employee Count by Education Level  
**Vertical bar charts** visualized the distribution of employees by education level, showing that individuals with bachelorâ€™s degrees formed the largest segment, followed by those with masterâ€™s qualifications.

### 5. Education vs Performance  
A **scatter or combined bar chart** was used to compare educational background with performance ratings. Employees with masterâ€™s degrees demonstrated the highest overall performance ratings.

## Income and Compensation Insights  

### 1. Salary Comparison by Gender and Education  
A **dual line chart** illustrated salary averages across education levels for both genders. This visualization helped identify patterns or discrepancies in pay between male and female employees.

### 2. Salary vs. Age by Department  
A **shape-based scatter chart** was used to show how salary correlated with age across departments. The visual highlighted senior roles with higher compensation and entry-level roles with more modest pay ranges.

## Dashboard Development  

Two key dashboards were created to summarize and communicate findings:

### **HR Overview Dashboard**  
- Displays workforce size, hiring and termination trends, department composition, and demographics.  
- Provides a top-level view of organizational dynamics.  

### **Employee Records Dashboard**  
- Offers detailed insights into individual employee profiles.  
- Supports filtering by gender, department, and education level for granular analysis.  

Both dashboards followed a structured design with minimal clutter, consistent color palettes, and intuitive filter controls.

## Key Insights  
- Workforce growth is evident over time, with consistent hiring trends.  
- Nairobi (headquarters) accounts for the highest employee concentration.  
- Gender balance remains strong, though salary differences exist between genders.  
- The majority of employees are within the 35â€“44 age group, indicating a seasoned workforce.  
- Higher education levels correlate positively with stronger performance outcomes.

---

## Challenges and Lessons Learned  
Developing the dashboard required balancing **clarity, accuracy, and design**.  
Some of the challenges included selecting the most effective visual types and managing data relationships for calculated measures.  

Key lessons learned:  
- Consistency in data formatting ensures smoother dashboard integration.  
- Simplicity enhances comprehensionâ€”fewer, clearer visuals have more impact.  
- Storytelling through visualization turns numbers into actionable insights.

## Conclusion  
The HR Analytics Dashboard illustrates how **data visualization** can transform workforce data into powerful insights that drive strategic decisions.  
Using Tableau, I was able to integrate data preparation, analytics, and visual storytelling into a cohesive, executive-ready solution.  

This project reflects strong technical capability in **data visualization, business understanding, and BI dashboard design**â€”key strengths I continue to build upon.
