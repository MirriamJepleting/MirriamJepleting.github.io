## Introduction  
This project focused on developing hands-on experience in **Business Intelligence** using **Power BI** for hotel management.  
The goal was to understand the business and client needs, load and transform data, build DAX measures, create dashboards, and publish the final project as part of a professional portfolio.

**Source Dataset:** [Codebasics End-to-End Data Analyst Project](https://codebasics.io/resources/end-to-end-data-analyst-project)

## Tasks Completed  
### 1. Installation and Initialization  
- Installed **Power BI Desktop** from Microsoft Store.  
- Set up the workspace for hotel data analysis.  

### 2. Data Wrangling  
- Imported CSV files using the folder path method.  
- Cleaned datasets, removed unnecessary columns like `date_type` from `dim_dates`.  
- Used **Power Query Editor** for transformations.  

### 3. Data Modeling  
- Designed a **Star Schema** with one **Fact Table** and multiple **Dimension Tables**.  
- Defined relationships among tables to ensure smooth aggregation and filtering.  

### 4. Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)  
- Created a **week number** column (converted from string).  
- Reintroduced and computed **day_type** column.  
- Defined **measures** for calculations to power visualizations.  

### 5. Dashboarding
