# Data Visualization with Tableau: HR Analytics Dashboard  
**Author:** Mirriam Jepleting  

---

## Introduction  
This project presents a comprehensive **Human Resources (HR) Analytics Dashboard** developed using **Tableau**. The goal was to visualize workforce data and uncover patterns in hiring, employee demographics, performance, and compensation.  

Through this project, I designed and implemented an end-to-end visualization processâ€”covering data preparation, exploration, and dashboard creationâ€”to enhance organizational decision-making through data-driven insights.  

**Dataset Source:** [Tableau HR Project â€“ Data With Baraa](https://www.datawithbaraa.com/tableau/tableau-hr-project-thank-you/)

## Project Objectives  
- Design an interactive dashboard to visualize HR metrics and workforce patterns.  
- Track employee hiring, retention, and turnover across years.  
- Analyze workforce demographics including gender, age, and education.  
- Identify salary and performance patterns across departments.  
- Provide executives with actionable insights for HR planning and policy design.

## Data Preparation and Exploration  
The dataset was imported into Tableau as a text file and explored through various dimensions and measures.  

### Data Formatting  
The initial setup involved:  
- Configuring consistent data types and field names.  
- Setting a unified dashboard theme using a **dark background with grey typography** for improved readability.  
- Defining custom color schemes to distinguish employee categories such as *Active*, *Terminated*, and *Hired*.  

### Exploratory Analysis  
Using Tableauâ€™s worksheet interface, data was explored through summary tables and charts to understand structure, missing data, and categorical distributions before dashboard construction.

## Summary Overview  

### 1. Workforce Overview  
KPI cards were created to display:  
- **Total Employees**  
- **Total Hired Employees**  
- **Total Terminated Employees**  

These indicators provided a high-level snapshot of the organizationâ€™s workforce composition.

### 2. Hiring and Termination Trends  
To examine workforce movement, **line charts synchronized with area charts** were used:  
- Hiring trends revealed the companyâ€™s growth trajectory.  
- Termination trends highlighted workforce stability and retention rates over time.

### 3. Departmental Structure  
A **bar chart** visualized the total employees by department and job title, revealing departments with the highest staffing levels and highlighting potential capacity gaps.

### 4. Headquarters vs Branch Comparison  
Using a comparative bar chart, employee counts between the **Nairobi headquarters** and other regional branches were analyzed. Results showed Nairobi as the primary employment hub with the highest workforce concentration.

### 5. Geographic Distribution  
A **map visualization** was developed to show employee distribution by town and region. The map effectively illustrated that Nairobi accounted for the majority of employees, offering geographical context for HR planning.

## Demographics Analysis  

### 1. Gender Distribution  
A **dual pie chart** displayed gender ratios, segmented by employment status (active vs. terminated). This helped identify gender balance across employment outcomes.

### 2. Age and Education Distribution  
A **bubble chart** revealed the relationship between age groups and education levels. This view helped identify workforce qualification patterns and the correlation between education and employee maturity.

### 3. Employee Count by Age Group  
A **horizontal bar chart** summarized the total number of employees within each age bracket. The age group **35â€“44** emerged as the most dominant segment, indicating mid-career maturity in the organization.

### 4. Employee Count by Education Level  
Vertical bar charts compared educational attainment across the workforce. Employees with **Bachelorâ€™s degrees** represented the largest share, followed by Masterâ€™s and PhD holders.

### 5. Education and Performance Correlation  
A **performance vs. education scatter chart** was used to examine how academic qualifications influenced performance ratings. Employees with **Masterâ€™s degrees** showed the strongest correlation with high performance.

## Income and Compensation Insights  

### 1. Salary Comparison by Gender and Education  
A **dual line chart** was created to compare average salaries across education levels for male and female employees. This view exposed salary disparities and potential gender pay gaps.

### 2. Salary vs. Age by Department  
A **shape-based scatter chart** visualized the correlation between employee age and average salary by department. This helped identify roles with the highest earning potential and observed how experience influenced compensation.

## Dashboard Development  

Two main dashboards were built to consolidate the insights:  

### **HR Overview Dashboard**  
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the organizationâ€™s workforce metrics, including total hires, terminations, departmental distribution, and employee demographics.  

### **Employee Records Dashboard**  
Focused on individual-level insights, this view allows HR teams to filter and explore detailed employee records interactively.

Both dashboards were structured with clean navigation, uniform color themes, and intuitive filters.

## Publishing and Access  

The final dashboards were published publicly on Tableau Cloud for viewing and sharing.

## Key Insights  
- Nairobi hosts the largest proportion of employees, confirming its role as the central hub.  
- Workforce growth is evident, with consistent hiring trends over the years.  
- Gender representation remains balanced, though minor salary discrepancies exist.  
- Most employees fall within the 35â€“44 age group, aligning with peak productivity years.  
- Employees with higher education (Masterâ€™s level) generally achieve stronger performance scores.

## Challenges and Learnings  
Building this dashboard required balancing aesthetics with analytical depth.  
Some challenges included:
- Maintaining visual clarity while integrating multiple KPIs.  
- Choosing chart types that best represented relationships between variables.  
- Ensuring responsiveness and interactivity in Tableau Public.  

The project enhanced my understanding of **data visualization principles**, **dashboard design**, and **storytelling with data** â€” essential skills for transforming raw HR data into executive-ready insights.

---

## Conclusion  
The HR Analytics Dashboard built with Tableau demonstrates how data visualization can turn complex workforce data into actionable intelligence.  
Through interactive dashboards, HR managers can monitor employee distribution, performance, and compensation trends efficiently.  

This project underscores my ability to combine **technical visualization skills** with **strategic business understanding**, delivering insights that drive organizational improvement.
