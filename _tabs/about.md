I am passionate about the exciting world of **Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)**.  
My curiosity drives me to transform raw data into meaningful insights and build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. 

## What I love working on  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Cleaning messy datasets, uncovering hidden patterns, and visualizing insights.  
- **Machine Learning:** Designing predictive models that learn from data and improve over time.  
- **Deep Learning:** Exploring the power of neural networks for complex tasks in images, text, and beyond.  
- **Artificial Intelligence Applications:** Building smart solutions that support automation, decision-making, and innovation.  

âœ¨ My goal is to continue sharpening my skills, pushing the boundaries of what data can reveal, and contributing to impactful projects where **data meets intelligence**.
